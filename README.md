# Farst-Network-Project
Revolution of digital technology
FarstNetwork is a flexible and decentralized payment network based on
blockchain technology.
The FarstNetwork geared towards to the freedom economic as well as
uncontrolled by any third party such as a bank or government.
To carry out that mission we created theFarstcoin (FRCT).
By combining cloud computing technology and the
blockchain, Farst Network provides an
instantaneous trading system without any fee. Farst
Network promotes the anonymity of transactions,
which means that all transactions within the Farst
network are kept secret and secured with the SHA-
256 algorithm. However,All transactions have been
tracked and recorded by the blockchain.
 Why Farst?
With many years of experience in the financial and
foreign exchange markets, we understand the
anxiety of traders when they participate in any
financial market is controlled. We all know every
market today being controlled by trading robots
created to make the market operate and collect
many profits for its owner whom can be a group or
market managers who are usually called as financial
whales
History and Formation.
Have you ever noticed that when trading in the
market for example bittrex or poloniex, your buy or
sell order is very slow? This is because you have to
spend a lot of time on order placing and
confirmation. But with robots everything is handled
by the APIs that make the transaction implemented
instantaneously and fastly. By combining many
technical indicators such as Bollinger Band, MACD,
RSI and ICHIMOKU with trading experience, we
have researched and developed the intelligent
trading system called The-Ocean-GarbageCollector
(TOGC) robot.By utilizing the available APIs of trading platforms, TOGC
robots can collect the data of all trading pairs in the market,
incorporating technical indicators to create smart algorithms
that to determine the buy and sell orders accurately and
quickly. In addition, the TOGC can reasonably calculate the
total trading volume and price fluctuations (spear) in order
to determine appropriate and safe volume when placing
buy/sell orders, ensuring all orders have the highest
probability of winning.
TOGC does not focus on high profits on one pair of
transactions but takesmall profits on all pairs with the
highest probability of winning so we call it as The-OceanGarbage-Collector.
TOGC has been researched and tested since May 2017
and has overcome many waves of the cryptocurrency
market with a winning rate of 95%.
Based on that success, we decide to create the Farst
network and plan to start the ICO in December 2017 with
the aim of expanding TOGCâ€™s operations in all markets
and creating a fully automated ecosystem for Farstcoin.,
Farst holders will have opportunity to make a lot of
profits even if they do not need to do anything.
